makefdb
-------
How do you make a generator template file?  Write some text in a flash
movie using MM Flash(4,5,..?), under "save as.." select "Generator
Template".  Feed that file into makefdb, and it'll save every font
def'n found therein into a file <font>.fdb.  If you don't save as a
template, it won't write the entire glyph set out, only the letters
you've actually used..  See, it's smart that way.

--------
There is a software named auto-trace (http://autotrace.sourceforge.net),
that can vectorize a bitmap (*.bmp,*.pbm,..)  and save it to swf (using
ming) only using SWFShapes. Then just "swfto... swffile" and  .. smile.
