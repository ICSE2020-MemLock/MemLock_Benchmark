Installing Ming

Last updated 14 January 2008.

  Unpack the Ming source tarball and go into the uncompressed
  directory.

    $ gunzip ming-0.4.0-beta.tar.gz
    $ tar xfp ming-0.4.0-beta.tar
    $ cd ming


  PHP
  ***

  (should work with PHP-4.0.2 and higher)

  The preferred method is to build Ming as a PHP module (.so file):

   1. Compile the main Ming library with its php extension

      $ ./configure --enable-php
      $ make

   2. Install everything (includes install of the PHP module)

      $ make install

   3. Configure PHP to load Ming.  You need to adjust your
      php.ini file, normally by adding:

      extension=ming.so

      The ming.so file should be in `php-config --extension-dir`
      which is taken care of by the 'make install' step.

      Note that apache will need a reload when changing the php.ini
      used by it's php module.

   The alternative way is to build Ming into the PHP source:

      $ mkdir <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cp php_ext/* <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cd <phpdir>
      $ ./buildconf
      $ ./configure --with-ming=<mingdir> <other config options>

   Then build and install php as usual, then restart your web server.


  PYTHON
  ******

  (You may need python 1.5.2 or higher)

      $ ./configure
      $ make static
      $ cd py_ext
      $ make mingcmodule.so

  Then fix the install path in the Makefile

  Then install

      $ make install


  PERL
  ****

  Read the README file in the perl_ext subdirectory.


  C/C++
  *****

  1. If you're using a development snapshot rather than a stable
     release then,
      $ sh autogen.sh

  2. Compile the library
      $ ./configure
      $ make

  3. Install (you usually need to be root to do this)
      $ make install

  By default it puts headers into /usr/local/include and libraries
  into /usr/local/lib. Do ./configure --help to see how to set
  an alternative location.

  By the way, the c++_ext subdirectory contains information and a
  test file, but there is no additional makefile or installation
  required to use C++.
