.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ratio defines the position of the control point
and RGBA defines its color.
SWF <= 7 allows up to 8 control points
SWF >= 8 allows up to 15 control points

The ration parameter is a float and must be in a range
between [0.0 ... 1.0].

In order to use SWF8 gradient features you need to set
SWFShapes version to SWF_SHAPE4. Use SWFShape_useVersion()
and friends.
