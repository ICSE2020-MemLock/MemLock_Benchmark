Item to write.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Usually MING waits with writing a display item until a frame is closed
through a nextFrame() call, because a display items state could be altered
for the current frame. By using SWFDisplayItem_flush() MING does not wait
and writes the frame immediately. Therefore a user can influence the
swf tag oder. Changing a display items state after calling flush() takes
effect in the next frame.
