Stuff what to do (not in order):

* More work on the new utils: Further testing, and completing the
  implementation for all of the different output formats.

* make leading/linespacing terminology consistent btwn text/textfield

* Change SWFButton::addShape to SWFButton::add and have it return a displayitem

* proofread/update PHP docs

* SWFText_addString splits buffer into 127 (255?) character chunks

* add $m->getStreamLength

* SWFText should recognise \n and advance the y pos?

* Comment the new universal ming.h

* Add access to button shape matrices and cxforms

* Read fonts from TTF/PS

* Make importable blocks/template format

  Seems kind of wasteful to run lots of code to define a shape that never
  changes.  It'd be better to dump the rendered shape definition out to a file
  and pull that in when needed.


* add proper error messages to compiler

  "parse error" just isn't quite lucid enough.


* getBounds for all drawable types

  ..so you can center text 'n' stuff.
  It exists in the c code, but there's no SWFRect in the php interface

* Produce good quality API documentation, pulled from comment embedded in
  the source.

* Produce thorough API tests, testing each interface from each language binding.

* propagate new features to all language bindings

* Ensure the API is consistant accross all language bindings

* Add additional Font APIs to allow script to detect font properties and make
  intelligent decsions. Also make sure the usage of Unicode vs ANSI based fonts
  is rational.

Wishlist items:

* Make animation easier

  Setting position on every frame is tedious.  I'd like to be able to tell
  an instance "head to point (x,y) in n frames".  Maybe simple newtonian
  mechanics, like "setVelocity" and "setAcceleration".  Or maybe I'll just
  make utility code in php first and see what works.

  Think the goal should be to not have the user stuck in the timeline (i.e.,
  abolish movie->nextFrame()), be able to put anything anywhere at any time.

  Callbacks look like the best way- you can pass an animate function which
  is called every frame..


* Make transforms easier

  Order of transform operations is currently fixed (skew, rotate, scale,
  translate).  So you can't easily rotate around a point off-center.  I'd made
  "path" objects trying to solve this, but they were confusing, hard to use.

  And, as noted already, there are transforms we can't get at now, like in
  buttons and text.


* Make newSWFMorph(shape1, shape2)

  Now that shapes have delayed completion this is possible.


* Clean things up

  Update header files.  Make names uniform.  Remove unused code.
  Fix ugly hacks.  Et cetera.


* Allow buffer-at-a-time output

  fput'ing each byte is probably slowing us down a lot..?
