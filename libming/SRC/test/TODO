(1)

For each binding provide a 'builder' module.
The builder is an executable file that takes
two arguments (input filename and output filename)
and generates the latter from the former, making
sure to use the not-yet-installed ming library.

For the 'C' binding this work would likely be better
done by libtool, to take architecture differences into
account. Other binding would probably be simpler.

(2)

Rewrite the 'dotest' executable in portable shell,
making use of the 'builder' modules.

(3)

Tweek the Makefile to invoke the 'dotest' executable
only with bindings enabled at configure time.
