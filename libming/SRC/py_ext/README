PMing - a Python module for the Ming library

WHAT'S NEW

- 08 Jul 2004: sspickle moves some of the new API into the ming.py wrapper.
		Lots more to do here... any help appreciated. ;-)
		Also.. in the absense of any suggestion otherwise.. 
		moving this mess to the main branch.

- 07 Jul 2004: sspickle adds a reincarnated Zwiff package (Zope ming thingy).
		You can just make a link in your instance home's Products directory
		to the Zwiff directory (or just copy it) and use it in Zope.

- 05 Jul 2004: sspickle finally gets distutils going for mingc. It 
		looks like we need changes to ming.i, but i don't know
		who else uses it... so I pulled a copy into py_ext for now.

- 19 Aug 2001: sspickle adds slightly more pythonic Setup/build.py
		(not using disttools just yet... but maybe next time!)

- 19 Nov 2000: Dave adds destructors, messes up the ming.py file so it
		acts like the php interface

- 24 Oct 2000: Dave makes an attempt at updating python wrapper for 0.0.3a

- 11 July 2000: First release. Preliminary python class wrapper done. 


FEATURES

Acts just like the PHP interface, so documentation is now usable. :)


REQUIREMENTS
- Python 1.5.2 or above.
- Ming library v0.2-pre-a
- a recent version of SWIG if you're going to rebuild ming_wrap.c
  (a reasonable ming_wrap.c is included now)
  SWIG 1.1p5 (which comes with Debian 2.2) won't work.
