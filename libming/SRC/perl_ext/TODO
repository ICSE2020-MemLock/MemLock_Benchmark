=head1 TODO

=head2 Feature Synchronization

make all functions that ming provides to the perl-extension too
as far as needed

=head2 CPAN

Setup the build environment, files and directories for distribution on cpan 
in a way that the ming-perl extension can be built on cpan automatically.

=head2 Documentation

Update pod documentation for the SWF modules where neccesary.
Please prevent 'podchecker *.pm' finding any errors.

In early 2009:  now every method has its own documentation.
In some very few cases there is only a stub, marked with "ToDo",
	grep ToDo * | wc -l
today counts just 12 (of nearly 300 methods) at all.

=head2 Tests

There are currently some very few tests in t. But there is a growing number 
of tests in ming lib itself, that can be run currently by

./configure --enable-perl
make
make check

They should be available when building on cpan too.

=head2 Bugs

Fix object memory bugs:
* check decrementing reference counter at DESTROY code
* check for memory leaks
* check for twice free() calls (via xs-code vs library-code)
