SWF.pm -- A perl interface for creating SWF files.

ABSTRACT:
---------

This is an auto-loadable interface module for Ming - a library for generating 
SWF ("Flash") format movies.

With this library you can create Flash movies on the fly with Perl.

INSTALLATION using CPAN
-----------------------

This is currently not finished. So skip to 'INSTALLATION using automake'

It is more a stub on CPAN to say 'Hey, here I am'.

In future it should contain ming releases (c and perl parts) like DBD::SQLite, 
so it can directly be installed over CPAN without extra efforts.


INSTALLATION using automake
---------------------------

1. Get the sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ming

2. Unpack the sources

	   tar xvzf ming-perl-XXX.tar.gz 
	or tar xvzf ming-perl-XXX.tar.bz2

3. Change to ming root directory, not ming-perl-XXX/perl_ext:

	cd ming-perl-XXX

3b. When using CVS sources create the configure script if it not exists by

	./autogen.sh


4. Run the configure script

	./configure --enable-perl --disable-cpp

Hints: 
   - type ./configure --help for all available options
   - c++ is currently enabled by default

Wait until this script finished successfully, else post to ming-users mailing list or bug report
or install missing packages when this is the reason for the failure.

5. Run make

	make

This compiles first ming itself, then language extensions and utils.
Wait until this finished successfully, else post to ming-users mailing list or bug report

6. Run make check
	
	make check

This runs all existing tests for ming and the enabled extensions.
When all tests pass without error go to next step, else post to ming-users mailing list or bug report

7. make install



INSTALLATION (old):
---------------------

Read these instructions all the way through before you start!

1.  Make sure you have downloaded Ming ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/ming ). If
    you haven't compiled Ming, it will be compiled during SWF.pm installation
    process (step 3 below).

2.  Unpack the tar file. (If you are reading this you have probably done this. :-))
    Under Unix type:

    tar xvzf ming-perl-XXX.tar.gz

3.  Compile:

	a.  cd ming-perl-XXX/perl-ext
	b.  perl Makefile.PL
	c.  make
	d.  make test (optional but recommended)
	e.  make install

	During step (b), Makefile.PL will try to find your Ming distribution. 
	If it fails, you will be asked to provide the Ming directory.

	If you want to install SWF into your home directory, replace step (b)
	with:

	b. perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/directory



AFTER INSTALLATION
------------------

There are a growing number of tests in several languages under the test/ directory.
This is a good source for what can be done with ming.

There are some cgi demos in the perl_ext/examples directory. THE EXAMPLES ARE NOT
PERLIASH (you can write it more succinctly in Perl).

After install there is too some (still incomplete) documentation accessible by manpages.
E.g. type 
		
	man SWF
	or
	man SWF::Shape 

	Hint: The KDE file and web browser Konqueror formats manpages automatic as nice HTML-files.
